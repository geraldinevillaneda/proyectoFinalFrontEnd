ESLint couldn't find the plugin "<%- pluginName %>".

(The package "<%- pluginName %>" was not found when loaded as a Node module from the directory "<%- resolvePluginsRelativeTo %>".)

It's likely that the plugin isn't installed correctly. Try reinstalling by running the following:

    npm install <%- pluginName %>@latest --save-dev

The plugin "<%- pluginName %>" was referenced from the config file in "<%- importerName %>".
